<div>
Choose colour to use when the worst job status in the view is 'disabled'.<br>
After 'unknown' and 'successful', the possible states from best to worst are 'disabled', 'unstable' and 'failed'.<br>
Perhaps 'grey', if you particularly want to alert people to disabled jobs, but probably best to leave tabs uncoloured for disabled jobs, as jobs are often disabled for quite valid reasons.
