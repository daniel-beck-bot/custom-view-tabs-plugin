<div>
Choose colour to use when the worst job status in the view is 'failed'.<br>
After 'unknown' and 'successful', the possible states from best to worst are 'disabled', 'unstable' and 'failed'.<br>
Probably 'red' to match the ball icon and to stand out. At first, go easy on tab colours for anything less severe than 'failed', in order to focus attention.
