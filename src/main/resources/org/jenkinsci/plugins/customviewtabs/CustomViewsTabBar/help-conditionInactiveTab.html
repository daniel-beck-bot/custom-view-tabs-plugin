Only use the label pattern when the view contains jobs that are disabled, unstable or failed.<br>
Otherwise use the original view name.<br>
It's probably better to leave this unchecked for the active tab because a detailed status message on the one active tab won't take up too much screen space.<br>
It may be better to check this for inactive tabs, so that the tabs with unsuccessful jobs stand out.<br>
Note that this setting does not affect tab colouring.
