	Specify the regex matcher to use for the $N3 view name replacement eg (\w)\w*|\s to select initial letters.<br>
	The view name is processed with replaceAll(regexMatch, regexReplacement).<br>
	Only need one backslash for escaping special characters.<br>
	<br>
	eg with '(\w)\w*|\s' and '$1', the initial letters will be kept<br>
	eg 'All The Jobs We Have' will be shortened to ATJWH<br>
	which is quite a neat way of shortening tab names when you have lots of tabs and use a consistent naming convention.<br>
	Alternatively, choose to only use the status information label patterns when there are unsuccessful jobs.
