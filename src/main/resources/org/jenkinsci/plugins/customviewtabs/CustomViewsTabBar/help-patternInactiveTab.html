<div>
	Set the labelpattern to use for tabs that are inactive.<br>
	    The label pattern may include any text and any of the following special identifiers that will be replaced with the current value:
    <ul>
	    <li>$N1 - The original view name
	    <li>$N2 - The original view name truncated according to the short name length setting
	    <li>$N3 - The original view name processed using replaceAll(regexMatch, regexReplacement) see elsewhere
	    <li>$T - The Total number of jobs
	    <li>$S - The number of jobs currently Succeeding
	    <li>$F - The number of jobs currently Failing
	    <li>$U - The number of jobs currently Unstable
	    <li>$D - The number of jobs currently Disabled
    </ul>
    For example, set the Inactive tab pattern to 
    <ul>
	    <li><strong>$N2: $S/$T</strong>
	</ul>
	to show something like
	<ul>
	    <li><strong>All: 2/4</strong>
	</ul>   
    Or set the Active tab pattern to
    <ul>
	    <li><strong>$N: $S OK, $F Broken, $U Dodgy</strong>
	</ul>
	to show something like
	<ul>
	    <li><strong>AllTheJobs: 2 OK, 1 Broken, 1 Dodgy</strong>
	</ul>
		Note that it's really up to you not to break it by using invalid characters that disrupt the HTML. Stick to regular text and you'll be fine.
